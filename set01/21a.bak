; Interpretation:
;  first-name is the first name of a person
;  last-name is the last name of a person
;  age is the age of a person
;  height is the height of a person in centimeters
;  weight is the weight of a person in kg

; person-image : Person -> Image
; GIVEN: takes an instance of person
; RETURNS: returns an image of a person proportionate to the 
;          height of the person. i.e. if one person is twice the size of
;          another person, the image for the first person should be twice as
;          high and wide as the image of the second person. This is calculated
;          by:
;          A person with height 180 cm is default height. Any person with height
;          greater than or smaller than this height will be scaled accordingly.
;          e.g. person with height 150 cm should be scaled by a factor of 
;          150/180. 

; Examples:

(define leg (rectangle 20 80 "solid" "blue"))
(define arm (rectangle 10 80 "solid" "brown") )
(define body (ellipse 70 100 "solid" "red") )
(define eye (ellipse 10 10 "solid" "black"))
(define face (ellipse 40 40 "solid" "brown"))
(define separator (line 5 0 "white"))
