Ex 10: Define a function that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the two larger numbers. As always, write down contract, purpose statement, and examples.

; sum-two-larger : Number Number Number -> Number
; GIVEN: Three numbers are passed as arguments.
; RETURNS: The sum of two larger number
; Examples:
; (sum-two-larger 15 10 5) => 25
; (sum-two-larger 11 11 2) => 22
; (sum-two-larger -4 2 4) => 6

(define (sum-two-larger x y z)
    (cond
      [(>(+ x y) (+ y z) and >(+ x y) (+ x z)) (+ x y)]
      ))
