Ex 8: The area included in a circle of radius r is given by the formula pi * r^2. 
Using the interaction window of DrRacket as a calculator, compute the area included in circles of radius 1, 5, and 7.

Write the contract, purpose statement, examples, and the definition of a function called circle-area that computes
the area included in a circle of radius r, using the above formula. Use the three calculations you did above as your examples.
